Alpha development stage for blackMail website

**Octover 23,2020 Update From Backleft:**

Added a run script into the directory ./run-script all it does is build the enviroment just run ./run-script -b

Edited __bounty.py__ on:

__line 7__: changed the Upload Folder path to be relative to whoever pulls the repo

__line 72__: Also changed the photoPath to be relative as well.

Edited on __index.html__:

only worked on trying to get the grid system to work but I didn't make much headway so what I put in there is negligable.

Edited __layout.html__ && layout.css: 

just added some styling to the files but I don't think any of them really work so you can ignore them.


# Thats all I did I'll also version control this and the previous version

October 13,2020 UPDATE From BackLeft:
Started writing flask python scripts under the directory called flask-BountMail

	new file:   create_db.py
	new file:   main.py
	new file:   requirements.txt
	new file:   settings.py

Also deleted the apache & php folders since they aren't needed anymore.

we can still deploy this using docker since its easy to run with scripts
