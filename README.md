October 13,2020 UPDATE From BackLeft:
Started writing flask python scripts under the directory called flask-BountMail
	new file:   create_db.py
	new file:   main.py
	new file:   requirements.txt
	new file:   settings.py

Also deleted the apache & php folders since they aren't needed anymore.

we can still deploy this using docker since its easy to run with scripts
